            <blockquote style = "font-size: 32px;">
              An operating server ran by XS should never allow the use of any types of administrator/staff abuse or ANY role higher than the player disallowing misconduct, plugin exploitation, or any other unfair means for player advantages for their own selfish needs or others.

Our Team        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 20px;">With the XS teams actual playercount being privately selected, a large team isn't a necessity to running the server. Administrator power is spread among few individuals, and moderation and server optimizaiton is always our teams main focus.

          Previous Servers
        </h2>
          <p style="">
          I'm sure you can't just take all of our statements into account
          without some examples of servers we've ran. Well, we have run servers,
          and helped smaller servers achieve success. While smaller communities
          will be kept anonymous, we can state our own creations. We've created
          an anarchy server, and an SMP that's still running!
        </p>
          <h3 style = "text-indent: 20px;">Vex Anarchy</h3>
          <p style="text-indent: 20px;">
          From the newly created anarchy server rose two people creating the
          greatness now known as XS. Leo and Ness both founded Vex Anarchy; a
          colossal success of an anarchy server. While keeping admin abuse to
          it's minimums, Vex Anarchy ran for around 2<sup>1/2</sup> years. With
          over 80 unique joins, it's safe to say with the wars and history build
          within the server by its community, the server was a success. <br />
          Vex Anarchy was later brought down in early 2020 due to a new server
          being ran (see below) that would shift priorities leaving Vex to
          dwindle.

          For its backstory, the Medium link is as follows: https://medium.com/@nessleickons/vexlys-history-96

        <h3 style = "text-indent: 20px;">XSCeon-2019</h3>
            <p style="">
          With a huge degree in success and an experiment gone right, the two
          team members expanded and created a newer server. This server would be
          the best server ran by XS called XS19. <br />
          With a privately invited seleciton of players, lore, wars, XS19 was a
          social success with more than 19 players and 4 veterans. Starting in
          late 2019, the server increased in popularity after SARS-Cov2 hit and
          became the pandemic we know today. With online becoming the new thing,
          more people joined causing the server to have much more
          interest.Throughout its history, XS19 had to keep conforming within
          its statement to satisfy players. Unfortunatly after early 2022, the
          server died out causing a massive overhaul and a leap attempt in early
          2023.
