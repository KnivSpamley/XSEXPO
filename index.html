              A Minecraft server of any type created under the influence of the

            <blockquote>
              An operating server ran by XS should never allow the use of any

              player disallowing misconduct , plugin exploitation, or any other

        <p>
          With our promises we intend to keep, we must have a team dedicated to
          ensuring our server can run with our intent. Our team is self run and
          self managed with power spread among 2 individuals. Ness and Leo
          Leickons are the sole executives of XS and manage the staff team
          helping to mantain the server and moderate it.

          Previous Servers
        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm sure you can't just take all of our statements into account
          without some examples of servers we've ran. Well, we have run servers,
          and helped smaller servers achieve success. While smaller communities
          will be kept anonymous, we can state our own creations. We've created
          an anarchy server, and an SMP that's still running!
        </p>
        <h3>Vex Anarchy</h3>
        <p>
          From the newly created anarchy server rose two people creating the
          greatness now known as XS. Leo and Ness both founded Vex Anarchy; a
          colossal success of an anarchy server. While keeping admin abuse to
          it's minimums, Vex Anarchy ran for around 2<sup>1/2</sup> years. With
          over 80 unique joins, it's safe to say with the wars and history build
          within the server by its community, the server was a success. <br />
          Vex Anarchy was later brought down in early 2020 due to a new server
          being ran (see below) that would shift priorities leaving Vex to
          dwindle.
        </p>
        <h3>XSCeon-2019</h3>
        <p>
          With a huge degree in success and an experiment gone right, the two
          team members expanded and created a newer server. This server would be
          the best server ran by XS called XS19. <br />
          With a privately invited seleciton of players, lore, wars, XS19 was a
          social success with more than 19 players and 4 veterans. Starting in
          late 2019, the server increased in popularity after SARS-Cov2 hit and
          became the pandemic we know today. With online becoming the new thing,
          more people joined causing the server to have much more
          interest.Throughout its history, XS19 had to keep conforming within
          its statement to satisfy players. Unfortunatly after early 2022, the
          server died out causing a massive overhaul and a leap attempt in early
          2023.
