        <h2 style="text-align: center; color: salmon">Season 9 Releases!</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">With a map size of over <i>1GB</i> and around <i>200 hours</i> of gametime, the XS team is proud to announce Season 9 of XS-19. </p>
  <p><b>What's new? </b>Season 9 presents a cleaner map than before, fixed major bugs, and reinstatement of many new mods. Season 9 does NOT feature a reset of the End, but plans for a complete overhaul will be present in Season 10.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; color: salmon">Current Server State</h2>
        <p>As of right now, XS-2019 is highly optimized and more bug free than Season 8's release. We're hoping to move to a higher end server host in a couple months for more flexibility. 
        </p>
  <ul>
<li>Approximatly 210 Overworld chunks have been generated with 9 total chunks being deleted (5% Corruption Rate)</li>
<li>Around 70 End chunks have been generated with ~30 chunks corrupted (~40% corruption rate). As of right now, the End will no longer be optimized with a possible reset next season.</li>
<li>Around 22 Nether chunks have been generated, none have ever been corrupted (0% Corruption rate)</li>
</ul>
  <p>*Corruption rates are based on the entirety of Season 8 (~6 months)</p>

        <p>Season 8 has less updates to the server as a whole, but new armor crate sets will be dropping! Our current drops:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Kronos Set</b> - Featuring Protection 5 Armor, and a powerful set of tools
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Tartarus Set</b> - Protection 10 Armor with the rarest trims, even more godly set of tools, and the life/death potions.
  </li>
  <li><b>NEW: Skylivier Set</b> - Rare blue trimmed Protection 4 Armor with feather falling 8 boots and a Punch 3 Bow with Power 6 and Flame 3.</li>
  <li><b>NEW: Arthier Set</b> - Rare orange trimmed armor with Flame Protection 5 and Blast resistance 5. An axe includes Fire Aspect 5, Sharpness 5, and efficiency 5. A pickaxe includes sharpness 5 and efficiency 8. </li>
</ul>
        <p>The Kronos Set and Tartarus Set have been both found by faction Vexian. The Tartarus set is currently the most advanced set to release with maximum protection meant to destroy enemies. The new Skylivier set (sky-live-ier) is meant to be the ultimate set for taking control of the skies. The Arthier set (arth-i-er) is the ultimate nether domination set. </p>
